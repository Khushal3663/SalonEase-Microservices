# SalonEase: Full-Stack Enterprise Microservices Ecosystem

SalonEase is a production-ready, distributed Salon Management system built using a cloud-native microservices architecture. The ecosystem is fully containerized, featuring a highly scalable Java/Spring Boot backend, a responsive React frontend, automated relational database bootstrapping, and robust infrastructure handling messaging and centralized configuration.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

This project is built using a decentralized microservices pattern, where each core business domain is isolated into its own independent service:

* **Frontend UI:** Built with React & Vite, compiled via multi-stage Docker builds, and served via high-performance Nginx routing.
* **API Gateway (`gatewayserver`):** The single entry point for all UI routing, handling dynamic proxying and security filters.
* **Service Discovery (`eurekaserver`):** Centralized service registry allowing elastic scaling and dynamic service-to-service communication.
* **Domain Microservices:** Isolated services managing specific business logic (`user`, `salon`, `service-offering`, `booking`, `category`, `payment`, `review`).
* **Asynchronous Messaging (`notification`):** Event-driven notification processor listening to decoupled events over RabbitMQ.
* **Centralized Database Instance (`mysqldb`):** Shared engine initializing 8 distinct database schemas seamlessly at startup via `init.sql`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Infrastructure

* **Backend Framework:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud (Gateway, Eureka), Hibernate/JPA
* **Frontend Framework:** React, Vite, Axios (with centralized Request Interceptors)
* **Database & Messaging:** MySQL 8.0, RabbitMQ 4.2
* **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose (Multi-stage execution paths)

## 🚀 One-Click Local Deployment

The entire ecosystem is orchestrated to boot seamlessly out of the box with zero manual environment configuration.
